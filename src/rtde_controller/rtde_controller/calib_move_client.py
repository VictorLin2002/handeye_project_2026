# DEPRECATED / UNUSED FILE
# ========================================================================
# This file was intended for calibration motion client functionality,
# but was never implemented. The functionality is handled elsewhere:
#   - For motion control: use move_client.py or rtde_node.py
#   - For calibration: use handeye_logger package
#
# This file is kept for reference but should be removed in future cleanup.
